The internet's response to NSA shenanigans.

Since apparently the NSA is in bed with big corporations that control the major websites that most people use on the internet,
and with most technology people use nowadays, our mission is to build and sell new technologies, websites, and stuff to
serve as alternates to the mainstream ones that the NSA has backdoor access into, to protect the privacy and freedom
of internet users everywhere.
